Faith is a journey best shared with others, and our community seeks to walk this path together in Christ’s love.

Here are the key ways we grow and strengthen our church community:

#### 1. Celebrate the Sacraments  
We actively participate in Mass, Baptism, Confirmation, and other sacraments, deepening our connection with God and the Church.

#### 2. Engage in Prayer and Fellowship  
Regular prayer meetings, Bible study, and fellowship events allow members to support one another and strengthen spiritual bonds.

#### 3. Serve the Community  
Through outreach programs, charity work, and cultural events, we live out our faith and share God’s love beyond the church walls.

#### 4. Support Youth and Vocations  
We encourage young members to develop spiritually, take leadership roles, and explore vocations within the Church.
